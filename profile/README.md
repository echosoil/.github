# ECHO Project: Engaging Citizens in Soil Science

**ECHO** is a Research and Innovation Action co-funded by the European Union under the Horizon Europe program and UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). The project, running from June 2023 to May 2027, aims to engage citizens in soil protection and restoration by improving their understanding and capabilities regarding soil health. [Visit the official website](https://echosoil.eu/).

## Purpose of This Organization

This GitHub organization is dedicated to hosting **all the Open Source code developed as part of the ECHO project**. Our goal is to ensure transparency, reusability, and collaboration with the wider community, supporting the project's mission of fostering citizen engagement in soil science.

All repositories under this organization adhere to Open Source principles and provide tools, applications, and data processing pipelines created during the project's lifecycle. Contributions and feedback are welcome to enhance the shared knowledge and impact of this initiative.

## Project Goals

- **Engage citizens**: Increase awareness and interest in soil health topics, motivating people to protect and restore soils.
- **Empower communities**: Enable citizens to actively participate in data collection and soil science to generate shared knowledge.
- **Facilitate decision-making**: Encourage citizens to take part in soil-related decision-making processes based on acquired knowledge.

## Project Partners

ECHO is a collaboration of 16 partners across Europe, including leading universities, research centers, SMEs, and foundations, coordinated by the Free University of Bolzano-Bozen. The project will assess 16,500 sites in different climatic and biogeographical regions to achieve its goals.

## Citizen Participation

The project will implement 28 tailored citizen science initiatives across EU Member States, taking into account various land uses, soil types, biogeographical regions, and stakeholder needs. Citizens are invited to actively contribute to these initiatives by collecting data on soil health.

## How to Contribute

Citizens can contribute to the ECHO project in several ways:

- **Become an ECHO Ambassador**: Help design citizen science initiatives, engage with community groups, and attend training sessions led by ECHO experts. [Learn more](https://echosoil.eu/become-an-echo-ambassador).
- **Participate as Citizen Scientists**: Join local citizen science initiatives, use soil sampling kits, and assist in data collection and analysis. [Find out how](https://echosoil.eu/for-participants).
